            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>
              My fascination with technology began in primary school and grew when my father challenged my brother and me to 
              build our own gaming PC at sixteen. He wanted us to understand how the parts worked together, not just enjoy the 
              final product. The process came with steep learning curves, but when we finally powered it on, 
              I felt both proud and accomplished. It was in that moment that I knew working with computers, and working in a team, 
              was what I wanted to pursue as a profession, and so I discovered my passion for computer science. 
              Throughout my time as a computer science student, I have established three goals and values that inspire everything I do: 
              work ethic, passion, and respect.
            </p>  
            <p>
              The first value I have upheld throughout my life is work ethic. I believe that accepting a task means accepting full 
              responsibility for completing it to the best of my ability. I first internalized this idea at Gunnersbury Catholic School 
              in London, whose motto ‚ÄúAd Altiora‚Äù (‚ÄúTo Higher Things‚Äù) I interpret as always striving for my best. When I worked for 
              DoorDash and accepted a large order that proved far more difficult than expected. Instead of cancelling, I did everything 
              I could to fulfill it, even contacting the customer directly to apologize and offer alternatives. Although the order was 
              eventually cancelled, the customer appreciated the effort, and I was proud to know I had honored my commitment. 
              This experience reinforced my belief that discipline and persistence are essential values I will continue to bring into 
              my professional life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second value that inspires everything I do is passion. I fundamentally believe that pursuing a career that you love 
              will play an integral part in being happy. Since first building a computer with my brother, I have been motivated not just 
              by the challenge but by the enjoyment I find in working with technology. This passion drives me to explore beyond assignments, 
              such as experimenting with new programming languages and personal projects like the website I built for my uncle‚Äôs company 
              outside of class. Doing what I love helps me stay motivated when I face setbacks, since I view them not as obstacles, 
              but as opportunities to learn more about something I truly care about.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third, and most important, value that guides me is respect. It was a core principle at Gunnersbury and has continued 
              to shape how I approach teamwork, especially in my Intro to Data Science final project. With teammates at different experience 
              levels, I made it a priority to listen and recognize everyone‚Äôs strengths. When one suggested a visualization method I hadn‚Äôt 
              used before, I encouraged us to try it, and it improved our results. By respecting my team‚Äôs contributions, I helped create 
              a collaborative environment that strengthened both our project and my own growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I approach the end of my undergraduate career and prepare to enter the workforce, I aim to continue upholding work ethic, 
              respect, and passion as my core values. From committing fully to every responsibility, to valuing the perspectives of others, 
              to pursuing computer science with genuine enthusiasm, these values have defined my growth as both a student and a professional. 
              Carrying them forward, I am confident that they will help me succeed in my career and allow me to contribute meaningfully to 
              any team and community I become part of.
